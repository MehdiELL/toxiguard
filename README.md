## What is this

Submit a comment; GenLayer validators independently judge it for toxicity and hate speech with an LLM, agree by consensus, and write the verdict on chain.

**Deployed contract (Testnet Bradbury):** [`0xE1775934cada0db0E706dC31eAcc7199E557cd3B`](https://explorer-bradbury.genlayer.com/address/0xE1775934cada0db0E706dC31eAcc7199E557cd3B)

## Why GenLayer

This is a subjective judgment over real-world text input - exactly what a
deterministic VM cannot do. GenLayer runs the LLM evaluation **inside consensus**, so the
result gets the same Byzantine-fault tolerance a normal chain gives to arithmetic.

## How it works

1. **`submit(text)`** - submit text to be evaluated.
2. **`evaluate(id)`** - each validator classifies the content
   (one of: safe, toxic, hateful) and scores it 0-100, then must **agree** on the label and a
   similar score via the Equivalence Principle.
3. The **label, score, and reasoning** are written on chain.

## The Intelligent Contract

`contracts/toxiguard.py` targets the GenVM Python runner (pinned by hash):

- **Integers only** - the severity score is `u8` (0-100); no floats.
- **Coarse-band equivalence** - validators must agree on the label and land within **+/-25**
  score, so heterogeneous LLMs converge instead of returning `Undetermined`.
- **Prompt-injection defense** - the input is treated as untrusted data.
- **Low-RPC reads** - `get_info()` / `list_items()` return state in one call.

Public methods: `submit`, `evaluate`, `get_item`, `list_items`, `get_info`.
